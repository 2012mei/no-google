## Youtube Advertisements Regex
>_^r.+\googlevideo.com$_

NOTE: This is supposed to prevent these domains to be
loaded not only on youtube, but on all over the web and,
since I'm trying to completely block google in my home,
I don't care if youtube is broken.
I'll may work on an efficient regex for this purpose.
